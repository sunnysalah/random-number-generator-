# random-number-generator-

This project will test the skills I have learned so far using html,css
and java script. I will be required to make a working random number generator, 
and style a website around it. It will require me to research how to make a 
random number generate. I will need to use flexbox, colors, fonts and various 
other css concepts in order to style the website around the number generator.
